## Problem Statement

We aim to create a web-app for hostel allotment that can be used in NIT Hamirpur. Currently every year, rooms have to alloted to students for their hostel in next year. This allocation is done manually by hostel officials. 

However, there are flaws in this system. A few of them are:
- It consumes about 12 hours. It is a very tiring job for both the students and the hostel committee.
- There are a lot of chances of corruption in the system.
- Proper verification of GPI doesn't take place because of less amount of time.
- Students do not have complete information about the hostel rooms currently allocated. So, they cannot make informed choices.
- Students have to be physically present in the allocation.

We will try to solve these problems by creating an automated system.


## Requirements

- Students should be able to register into system by themselves in a group of three or individually depending upon hostel.
- Students will be able to see currently unallocated rooms.
- They will fill choices according to their preferences and current scenario of rooms allocated.
- There will be about 3-4 rounds. 
- In each round, first there will be a mock live allocation. It will be used by students to fill up their preferences and check the scenario of whether they have chances of getting the rooms they desire. This round will be of 4-5 hours. Users will be updated about the room status after every 10 minutes.
- After the previous live allocation, each user will edit their choice (if they want to) and lock their choices.
- At the end of the round, each user will be shown the room they are getting. They will have choice to either lock the room or, continue with allocation and move to next round.
